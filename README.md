# HibernateBulkOperation

BulkOperation
============
=> To select or manipulate one or more record/object having our choice criterial
value we need to go for "Bulk operation".
a. HQL.
b. Native SQL.
c. Criterian API.
HQL
====
1. HQL stands for Hibernate Query Language.
2. It uses Objects based Query Language(these queries will be written based on the
entity class names and properties name)
3. Hibernate dialect internally converts HQL queries to DB specific SQL Queries.
4. HQL queries are DBIndependent and they supports portability.
5. HQL supports both select and non-select operation
6. HQL can also be used to perform SingleRowOperation(SRO) and also for bulk
operation having our choice conditions/
criteria.
7. HQL supports positional params(?)(supported only in older versions) and also it
supports named params(=:name)
8. HQL keywords are not case sensitive,but entity class names and properties names
are case sensitive.
9. HQL supports relational operators, conditional statements, joins,aggregate
functions, projections,....
eg:
SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO>=? AND EMPNO<=?
HQL> FROM in.ineuron.entity.Employee WHERE eno>=? AND eno<=?(positional param)
HQL> FROM in.ineuron.entity.Employee WHERE eno=:firstNum AND eno=:secondNum(named
param)
SQL> DELETE FROM EMP WHERE JOB=?
HQL> DELETE FROM in.ineuron.entity.Employee WHERE job=?
HQL> DELETE FROM in.ineuron.entity.Employee WHERE job=:desg
Note: if we are selecting all columns/properties in the HQL Select query then
placing select keyword is optional.
HQL select Queries
a. Entity Queries(Getting all properties values of the record)

eg: FROM in.ineuron.entity.Employee(with or without condition)
b. Scalar Queries(Getting specific column or specific multiple column values)
eg: SELECT eno,ename,eaddr FROM in.ineuron.entity.Employee (with

or without condition)

SELECT eno From in.ineuron.entity.Employee(with or

without condition)

SELECT count(*) From in.ineuron.entity.Employee

Example to get All the records from the DBTable using hibernate
=====================================================
Query<Employee> query = session.createQuery("FROM in.ineuron.Model.Employee");
List<Employee> employees = query.list();
employees.forEach(employee -> System.out.println(employee));
Note:
If we use xml approach setter and getter methods are mandatory, but if we use
Annotations for mapping setter and getter
methods are not required, hibernate internally uses reflection api and it binds the
value from ResultSet to private properties
of the Model.
Note:
In plain jdbc converting ResultSet object to DTO object is a manual process, where
as in orm framework like hibernate,
spring jdbc, spring orm and spring datajpa same happens internally using
"rowmapper"concept.
list() or getResultList()
==================
1. It internally uses eager loading for bulk operations.
2. It returns the collection directly.
3. Generates only one query to get all the records.
4. suitable for good performance.
5. It won't generate proxy object.
6. It is not deprecated and it is the industry standard approach.
iterate()
======
1. It internally uses lazy loading for bulk operation
2. It returns the iterator pointing to collection object.
3. Generates n+1 query to get all the records.
4. Not suitable, it degrades the performance.
5. It generates Proxy object.
6. It is deprecated becoz of performance issue.
Bulk operation for retreiving the record
-----------------------------------------------------
a. All columns ========> List<EntityType>
b. multiple columns ====> List<Object[]>
c. only one column ====> List<datatype of property>
Note: To avoid null checking in our application,we can use JDK8 supplied api called
"Optional".
Employee employee = query.uniqueResult();
if (employee != null)
System.out.println(employee);
else
System.out.println("Record not found for the given id ::"+id);
Optional<Employee> optional = query.uniqueResultOptional();
if (optional.isPresent()) {

Employee employee = optional.get();
System.out.println(employee);

} else{

System.out.println("Record not found for the given id :: " + id);

}

Note: we should use get()/load() if we are getting record based on primary key
value,
we can use uniqueResult()/uniqueResultOptional() if we are getting
record based on non-primary key value.
